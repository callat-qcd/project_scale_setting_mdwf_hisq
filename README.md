The analysis was performed by Nolan Miller (`master` branch) and Logan Carpenter with cross checks by Andr√© Walker-Loud (`andre` branch).

The raw correlation functions are contained in the file `data/callat_mdwf_hisq_scale_correlators.h5` and the bootstrap results for the ground state masses and values of `Fpi` are contained in the file `data/omega_pi_k_spec.h5`.
