# Scale setting with m<sub>&Omega;</sub> and w<sub>0</sub>

This repository performs the chiral, continuum and infinite volume extrapolations of `w_0 m_Omega` to perform a scale setting on the [MDWF on gradient-flowed HISQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07559) action.  The present results accompany the scale setting publication available at [arXiv:2011.12166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12166).

The analysis was performed by Nolan Miller ([millerb](https://github.com/millernb)) with the `master` branch, and Logan Carpenter ([
loganofcarpenter](https://github.com/orgs/callat-qcd/people/loganofcarpenter)) with cross checks by Andr√© Walker-Loud ([walkloud](https://github.com/walkloud)) on the `andre` branch.

The raw correlation functions can be found [here](https://a51.lbl.gov/~callat/published_results/) and the bootstrap results for the ground state masses and values of `Fpi` are contained in the file `data/omega_pi_k_spec.h5`.


## How to use

### Running the analysis

To generate the extrapolation and interpolation results from the paper, run `python scale-setting.py -c [name]`. This will automatically create the folder `/results/[name]/` . A summary of the results is given inside `/results/[name]/README.md`. Extra options can be viewed by running `python scale-setting.py --help`, which is given below for convenience.

```
usage: scale-setting.py [-h] [-c COLLECTION_NAME] [-m MODELS [MODELS ...]] [-ex EXCLUDED_ENSEMBLES [EXCLUDED_ENSEMBLES ...]] [-em {all,order,disc,alphas}] [-df DATA_FILE] [-re] [-mc] [-nf] [-na] [-d]

Perform scale setting

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COLLECTION_NAME, --collection COLLECTION_NAME
                        fit with priors and models specified in /results/[collection]/{prior.yaml,settings.yaml} and save results
  -m MODELS [MODELS ...], --models MODELS [MODELS ...]
                        fit specified models
  -ex EXCLUDED_ENSEMBLES [EXCLUDED_ENSEMBLES ...], --exclude EXCLUDED_ENSEMBLES [EXCLUDED_ENSEMBLES ...]
                        exclude specified ensembles from fit
  -em {all,order,disc,alphas}, --empirical_priors {all,order,disc,alphas}
                        determine empirical priors for models
  -df DATA_FILE, --data_file DATA_FILE
                        fit with specified h5 file
  -re, --reweight       use charm reweightings on a06m310L
  -mc, --milc           use milc's determinations of a/w0
  -nf, --no_fit         do not fit models
  -na, --no_average     do not average models
  -d, --default         use default priors; defaults to using optimized priors if present, otherwise default priors
```

To fine-tune the results, either re-run the fits using the options above or by modifying `/results/[name]/settings.yaml`. Similarly, the fits can be constructed with different priors by editing `/results/[name]/priors.yaml` and re-running `python scale-setting.py -c [name]`.

In addition to this library, this repo contains Juypyter notebooks. The fit for a single model can be explored in `/notebooks/fit_model.ipynb`. The model average is provided in `/notebooks/average_models.ipynb`. Some miscellaneous drudgery (eg, the paper's sensitivity figure) is available in `/notebooks/bespoke_plots.ipynb`.

### Using these results for other projects

To reuse this work for other CalLat projects where a scale is needed, use the pickle produced from `/notebook/generate_scale_setting_pickle.p`. Note that the entries in this dictionary are correlated, as the determinations of the lattice spacings are correlated by the gradient flow scales. The keys are like

```python
scale_setting_pickle = {
  'w0_org:w0'       : 0.1713 (12), # the gradient flow scale (in fm) w_0 per the original definition
  'w0_org:a06'      : 2.986 (12),  # reciprocal lattice spacing of the ~0.06 fm ensembles in w_0 units, i.e w_0/a_06
   # ... some entries omitted
  't0_org:sqrt_t0'  : 0.1414 (12), # the gradient flow scale \sqrt{t_0} per the original definition
  't0_org:a06'      : 6.587 (25),  # reciprocal lattice spacing of the ~0.06 fm ensembles in sqrt{t_0} units, i.e \sqrt{t_0}/a_06
   # ... etc
  'w0_imp:w0'       : 0.1716 (12), # the gradient flow scale (in fm) w_0 per the improved definition
  'w0_imp:a06'      : 2.997 (12),  # reciprocal lattice spacing of the ~0.06 fm ensembles in w_0 units using the improved definition
   # ... etc

   # meta data suggesting the priors/settings used to generate scale_setting.p
   # check /results/ folder
  'meta'            : {
    'original_scales': '2023_06_20-original_simultaneous',
    'improved_scales': '2023_06_20-improved_simultaneous'}
}
```

To convert to physical units, simply compute, e.g., 

```python
scale_setting_pickle['w0_org:w0'] / scale_setting_pickle['w0_org:a06'] # = 0.05718(53) fm ~ 0.06 fm
```

## Requirements

This work makes extensive use of Peter Lepage's Python modules [`gvar`](https://github.com/gplepage/gvar) and [`lsqfit`](https://github.com/gplepage/lsqfit), which are used to construct the fits and model average. Further, the settings and priors are primarily tweaked by the accompanying `yaml` files loaded via [`PyYAML`](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml).
